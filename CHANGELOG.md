# Changelog

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- `Rooster.app` macOS launcher: single-line AppleScript, auto-activates venv, no extra terminal text
- Dashboard pre-built `src/ui/dist/` committed to repo (no Node.js needed after clone)
- Integrated full-featured visual download manager (AriaNg) directly into the Rooster Dashboard interface.
- Implemented dynamic, zero-hardcoding connections (`getAriaNgUrl`) to automatically bind local Aria2 RPC URL and tokens dynamically from configuration.
- Synchronized comprehensive English and Chinese translation keys for the Downloader tab and descriptions in both `dashboard.html` and `i18n.js`.

### Fixed
- macOS Python SSL certificate verification: auto-set `SSL_CERT_FILE` to certifi bundle in config init
- start.bat: auto-activate `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` before running guardian
- Resolved Steps timeline stream merging issue where AI assistant stream text outputs were displayed word-by-word due to run ID mismatch (snake_case/camelCase keys) and early loops termination on undefined keys.
- Correctly restored and persisted `run_id` / `runId` in dashboard local storage cache to prevent log caching merge breakages.

### Changed
- Remove `start.command` (logic internalized into `Rooster.app`)
- `.gitignore`: exclude `src/ui/dist/` from global `dist/` ignore rule
- `.env.local.example`: add proxy and SSL_CERT_FILE template
- README: macOS launch instructions with Sequoia Gatekeeper note
